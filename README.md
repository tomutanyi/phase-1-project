# Phase 1 Project: Rush Rental App

### Project Description

This is a website that allows users to view available cars on the website, reserve cars, add cars to the website and delete cars from the website.
All of these changes are permanent and are reflected on the db.json file. They persist even after reloading the page.

Here is a [link](https://medium.com/@tomutanyi/my-moringa-school-phase-1-project-6a91ccd49a72) to my blog post on the project. 

### Project Setup

The project requires the installation of Node in order to work. You can find the instructions to install Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

The project requires the installation of a json server by entering the following command into your terminal:

`npm install -g json-server`

One then starts the server by entering this command:

`json-server --watch db.json`

The server should then be up and running. It is important to note that this is an essential step in the running of the project and without these commands, it will be impossible to fetch the data from the db.json file.

To stop running the server, one can simply open up a terminal and type in:

`CTRL + c`

The index.html file can then be run on any mordern browser.
